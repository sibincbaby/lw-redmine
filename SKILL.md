name: lwr
description: Use the lwr CLI to read and mutate Redmine issues from an AI agent. Every command speaks JSON, fails with stable error codes, never prompts in non-TTY contexts, and resolves human names (project, user, status) to Redmine ids transparently. Activates whenever the user asks to find, view, assign, comment on, transition, or create issues, tasks, bugs, or projects on this Redmine instance.

# lwr — Redmine for AI agents

`lwr` is a Redmine CLI built for agent consumption. **Every** command:

- Takes `--json` and emits the `lwr/v1` envelope (`{schema, command, ok, data|error, meta}`).
- Fails with a stable `error.code` string and a distinct exit code.
- Refuses to prompt when stdin is not a TTY — missing values become `VALIDATION_MISSING_FLAG` errors with a `hint`, never a hung process.
- Resolves human names — project name, user name, status name — to Redmine ids automatically, using a local cache.
- Preflights every status transition against the issue's `allowed_statuses` so a forbidden status edit is rejected **before** the PUT.

**You should always pass `--json`.** Pretty mode is for humans; do not parse it.

---

## Install — if `lwr` isn't on PATH

If running any `lwr ...` command returns `command not found` (or `which lwr` is empty), the user hasn't installed lwr yet. Don't ask the user to do it themselves — run the installer for them, then retry the original question.

**One-shot install** (preferred — the script handles Node/build/link/skill snapshot in one go):

```bash
node /path/to/lw-redmine/install.mjs install
```

The repo path is whatever directory contains the cloned `lw-redmine` source. If you don't know where it lives, ask the user once. After the script exits successfully, `lwr` is on PATH and the skill is freshly mirrored — your *next* command works.

**Base URL — you set this, not the user.** Before the credential step, `lwr` needs to know which Redmine instance to talk to. If you ever see `CONFIG_BASE_URL_MISSING` in an error envelope (e.g. on a fresh public-repo install), it means no URL has been configured yet. The URL is NOT sensitive — ask the user once and persist it yourself:

> "I need your Redmine URL to continue (e.g. https://redmine.yourcompany.com). What is it?"

Then run `lwr config base-url <url>` directly in this session. After it succeeds, retry the original command (or proceed to the credential step below).

**Credential step — the user runs this, not you.** After install (and after the base URL is set), `lwr` has no API key yet. Do **not** run `lwr auth login` from inside this session, and do **not** pass `--password '...'` or `--api-key <key>` on the command line — those flags route the user's credential through your chat transcript and the shell history. Instead, give the user this exact instruction:

> Open a separate terminal and run `lwr auth login`. Come back here when it prints "logged in" — I'll continue from there.

Once the user confirms, verify with `lwr auth whoami`. After a successful login `~/.lwr/me.md` exists; re-read it before continuing the original task (see `⚡ Read this first` below).

If `node install.mjs install` ever fails (e.g., Node < 20, npm not on PATH), surface the error verbatim and stop — don't try to repair the environment.

---

## ⚡ Read this first — your user context

Before answering anything that involves "me / my issues / my work / on my plate," **read `~/.lwr/me.md`**. It tells you:

- The user's Redmine identity (id, login, full name).
- The **active project** (sticky across sessions, only changes when the user explicitly says "switch to ..."). Use it as the implicit `--project` for any question that doesn't name one.
- Every role they hold on this Redmine — `developer`, `tester`, `qa`, `lead` — and which **custom field id** backs each role on this instance.
- The complete **list of projects they're a member of** — the closed set you should match against when the user names a project loosely ("AMS V4" → "Acme Portal V2").
- The two built-in lenses (`assignee`, `reporter`) that work for any user without profile data.
- Disambiguation guidance for ambiguous questions ("my plate").

If `~/.lwr/me.md` doesn't exist, the user isn't logged in. Run `lwr auth login` (it prompts the user's TTY for credentials and runs a full prefetch — identity, memberships, statuses dictionary, projects index, members of every project the user is in). After login exits, `me.md` is on disk; re-read it before continuing the original task.

If the user asks to "update the skill" / "refresh the skill" / "reload the skill", run `lwr update-skill --json`. It re-snapshots `~/.lwr/skill/SKILL.md` from the repo and re-links every AI tool's skill folder. The change takes effect on the *next* agent session — your current session already loaded the old SKILL.md at start.

If the user asks to "update lwr" / "upgrade lwr" / "pull the latest lwr", run `lwr update --json`. It runs the full repo update (git pull → npm install → build → npm link → skill snapshot) by delegating to `node <repo>/install.mjs update`. Slow (10–30 s) and hits the network; only run when the user explicitly asks.

### Project scoping

Most "what's on my plate?" / "list issues" questions are implicitly scoped to one project — the user's active one. Default behavior:

1. If the user explicitly names a project ("issues in CHT"), match against `me.md`'s membership list and pass `--project <identifier-or-id>`.
2. If the user doesn't name a project, use the **active project** from `me.md` as the implicit scope (no need to pass `--project` — most commands fall back to it via the profile).
3. If the user says "across all my projects" or similar, omit `--project` entirely.
4. If the user says "switch to <project>", run `lwr project use <name> --json`. Verifies the project exists and updates `me.md`. Until then, stay on the current active.

**Active project auto-syncs with active issue.** `lwr issue use <id>` auto-updates `activeProject` to match the issue's project when they differ. The two pointers never diverge — an "active issue" implies "active project = the issue's project". Unscoped queries (`lwr issue list --as developer`) then default to where the user is actually working. Look for `projectSwitched` in the `issue use` response to know whether the project changed.

### Why "me" is not always `assigned_to`

At this workflow the `assigned_to` field on an issue is usually the **requestor** or **team lead** — *not* the developer doing the implementation. The developer lives in custom field 79 ("Developer"); the tester lives in cf 88 ("Tester"); etc. So when the user (a developer) asks "what am I working on," the right query is `cf_79=<userId>`, NOT `assigned_to_id=<userId>`. `me.md` records this mapping per user.

### Picking the right lens from the question

> **Critical:** in this workflow the Redmine `assigned_to` field is usually the requestor / lead — *not* the implementer. So when the user says "assigned to me," "my issues," "my plate," etc., they mean their **cf-backed role**, NOT the `assigned_to` field. Route those phrasings to the role lens.

| User says | Lens | Resolves to |
|---|---|---|
| "my issues / my work / my tasks / assigned to me / on my plate / what am I working on" | `--as <user's cf-role from me.md>` (default) | `cf_<id>=<userId>` |
| "what am I developing / coding / implementing / fixing" | `--as developer` (explicit) | `cf_<dev>=<userId>` |
| "what am I testing / verifying / regression" | `--as tester` | `cf_<tester>=<userId>` |
| "QA queue / quality / sign-off" | `--as qa` | `cf_<qa>=<userId>` |
| "leading / managing / overseeing / shipping" | `--as lead` | `cf_<lead>=<userId>` |
| "everything across all my hats" | `--as any` | union of every role above |
| **Explicit only:** "where I'm listed as assignee in the Redmine UI / issues on my Redmine board / `assigned_to` field is me" | `--as assignee` | `assigned_to_id=<userId>` |
| **Explicit only:** "I reported / I opened / I created / I logged" | `--as reporter` | `author_id=<userId>` |

`--as assignee` and `--as reporter` are **only** for the user's explicit, literal references to the Redmine fields. For everything else routed by intent ("my work / my plate / assigned to me"), pick the cf-role lens from `me.md` — that's what the user actually means.

If the user has **only one role** in `me.md` → use that lens for ambiguous "my plate" questions. If multiple → ask once or use `--as any`.

For odd custom-field filters not modelled by a lens, use the escape hatch:
```bash
lwr issue list --cf <cfId>=<value>   # repeatable; e.g. --cf 94=425  (Assigned Team)
```

---

### 🔍 "Open" tickets — the filter actually means "on my plate"

Note: the Redmine `is_closed` flag is `false` on **every** status — including `Closed`, `Resolved`, `Rejected`, `Obsolete`, `Verified & Closed`, `delivered`, `Shipped`. That makes the native `status_id=open` a no-op, which used to leak done tickets into "show me my open tickets." lwr now post-filters those terminal names by default.

**What `lwr issue list` (no `--status` flag) or `--status open` returns:**

- Drops rows whose status is in `EFFECTIVELY_DONE_STATUS_NAMES` (Closed, Resolved, Rejected, Obsolete, Duplicate, Verified & Closed, delivered, Shipped, canceled, completed).
- Reports the drop count via `meta.excludedByName` in the JSON envelope:
  ```jsonc
  "excludedByName": {
    "count": 7,
    "names": ["Resolved", "Resolved", "Closed", ...],
    "doneFilterActive": true,
    "userExcluded": []
  }
  ```

**Use the meta to offer in natural language.** When `excludedByName.count > 0`, your reply should mention it and ask whether the user wants those included. Example:

> Showing 18 of 65 tickets on your plate. I hid 7 done-state ones (Resolved, Closed). Want me to include those too?

If the user says yes → re-run with `--include-done`.

**Narrowing further to "currently in my court":**

Handoff statuses like `Development Completed`, `Testing completed`, `Grooming Completed`, `Dev Analysis Completed` are still technically open — the issue's just sitting with QA or the next role. If the user says "what's actually waiting on me right now?" → re-run with:

```bash
lwr issue list --as developer --exclude-status "Development Completed,Testing completed,Grooming Completed,Dev Analysis Completed" --json
```

The `meta.excludedByName.userExcluded` echoes back what you filtered, so you can confirm with the user.

**Don't:**

- Don't pass `--include-done` by default. The default is the right answer for "show me my open tickets."
- Don't list `--status` with a specific name (e.g. `--status "Resolved"`) when the user said "open" — that defeats the filter. `--status` is for *naming a specific status*, not for adjusting the default.
- Don't try to post-filter on your own by parsing the JSON. The CLI did it; use `meta.excludedByName` to know what happened.

## 💬 Open-ended prompts — `lwr home`

When the user starts a turn with **a greeting** ("hi", "hey", "good morning"), **a vague check-in** ("what's up?", "where am I?", "any updates?"), or **a slash command like `/lwr` with no arguments**, do not improvise a generic reply. Run `lwr home --json` first.

```bash
lwr home --json
# → {
#     "greeting":    { "period": "morning", "name": "Sibin C Baby", "text": "Good morning, Sibin." },
#     "context":     { "configured": true, "authed": true,
#                      "activeIssue": { "id": 126208, "subject": "...", "status": "Development in Progress" },
#                      "rolloverPending": false,
#                      "lastWorkLogDate": "2026-05-23" },
#     "suggestions": [ { "cmd": "lwr issue current", "reason": "You're on #126208 — ...", "priority": 2 },
#                      { "cmd": "lwr log show --today", "reason": "...", "priority": 3 },
#                      ... ]
#   }
```

Use the envelope to compose a *grounded* reply **in natural language** — the user is talking to you, not to a shell. The `cmd:` field of each suggestion is your internal handle (what to run when the user says yes); the `reason:` field is the hint for what to *offer*. Never paste `cmd:` verbatim into your reply.

Compose like this:

- Open with `greeting.text` (or rephrase using `greeting.name` — first name is usually friendlier).
- Quote `context.activeIssue` when one exists ("you're still on #126208"). **See the freshness rule below before mentioning `.status`.**
- Surface `context.activeIssueCleared` as the FIRST thing if present — it means the previously-active issue was found closed in Redmine and the sticky pointer was auto-cleared. Report the clear ("your #126208 is now Closed on Redmine") instead of pretending it's still active.
- Surface `context.rolloverPending` as the first thing if true — that's the signal that yesterday's work needs handover before anything else.
- Pick 2-3 from `suggestions` and offer them as plain-English questions. When the user picks one, run the matching `cmd:` for them.

**Bad — leaks the CLI into the conversation:**

> Good morning, Sibin. A few directions:
> - `lwr log show --today` — review what you've logged
> - `lwr issue list` — show open tickets
> - `lwr time list` — check this week's hours

**Good — same suggestions, natural language:**

> Good morning, Sibin. You don't have an active issue right now. Want me to pull up today's log, show your open tickets, or summarise this week's logged hours?

The user only sees what they'd say out loud. You hold the `cmd:` strings.

Don't:

- Don't run `lwr home` and then ignore what it returned ("good morning! how can I help?" without acknowledging the active issue is a regression).
- Don't run `lwr home` before *every* turn — only when the user's prompt is genuinely open-ended. If they asked "show me #122047", just do that.
- Don't paste `lwr foo bar` style commands in your reply. The exception is when the user explicitly asked how to do something via the CLI (e.g., "what's the command for…?") — then you may quote it.
- Don't fall back to a hard-coded list of suggestions when memory is empty — the JSON envelope already includes sensible fallbacks (`issue list`, `time list`, `--help`).

This is the only verb where bare `lwr` (no subcommand) and `lwr home` are equivalent.

## 🪢 Reconciling local pointer vs live Redmine

The `home` and `issue current` envelopes don't just trust `profile.activeIssue` anymore — they also query Redmine for whatever currently sits in dev-active statuses for the user (the single-active-issue mutex). The reconciled verdict lands in the context as one of these four optional fields:

| Field | Meaning | What to ask the user |
|---|---|---|
| `discoveredActiveIssue: { id, subject, status, project, tracker }` | Local pointer is empty; Redmine has exactly one issue in dev-active for you. | "Looks like #X is in '\<status\>' on Redmine — want me to set that as your active issue?" → on yes, run `lwr issue use <id>`. |
| `activeIssueConflict: { local, redmine }` | Local pointer points one way, Redmine has a different issue in dev-active. | "Your sticky pointer says #X but Redmine has #Y in '\<status\>'. Which one is current?" → run `lwr issue use <id>` for the chosen one (the other one's status in Redmine will need fixing). |
| `mutexViolation: { issues: [...] }` | Redmine has more than one issue in dev-active for you — the "one at a time" rule is broken. | "Multiple issues are sitting in dev-active: #X, #Y, #Z. Which is current? I'll pause the others." → use `lwr issue use <chosen>` + `lwr issue pause <others>`. |
| `activeIssueCleared: { previousId, currentStatus }` | Live-refresh found the previously-active issue closed in Redmine — pointer auto-cleared. | "Your #X is now \<status\> on Redmine — I cleared the sticky pointer. Want to pick a new one?" |

Important rules:

- **Never auto-adopt a discovery.** Always ask first, then run `lwr issue use <id>`. The user owns the decision.
- **Treat `mutexViolation` and `activeIssueConflict` as blockers.** Don't proceed with any other mutating action (status changes, time logging, notes) until the user has clarified which issue is current — otherwise you risk operating on the wrong one.
- The four fields are mutually exclusive with `activeIssue`: when `activeIssue` is populated, the local + Redmine view is aligned (or Redmine wasn't reachable and we fell back to cached).
- All of these signals are best-effort. If Redmine is unreachable, the discovery fields stay `null` and the agent falls back to the cached `activeIssue` (with `freshness: 'stale'`).
- The discovery half is **cached in-process for 60s** (most useful in `lwr serve` MCP mode where a single process handles many tool calls). Pass `--no-cache` to `lwr home` or `lwr issue current` when you suspect the cache is stale — e.g., right after the user said they just changed status in the Redmine UI. The envelope's `meta.activeIssue.cacheHit` tells you which mode you got.

### 🚨 Don't infer "no active issue" from `me.md` alone

`~/.lwr/me.md` is a **rendered snapshot of local state only**. When it says "Active issue: unset locally", that ONLY means the sticky pointer in `~/.lwr/config.json` is empty — it does NOT mean the user has no current work on Redmine. They may have changed an issue's status to "Development in Progress" through the Redmine UI without going through lwr.

**The contract for every verb that needs the current issue when the user didn't name one:**

```bash
lwr issue current --json     # the authoritative reconciled view
```

Branch on the envelope:

- `activeIssue` populated → use `activeIssue.id`.
- `discoveredActiveIssue` populated → ask user once ("Looks like #X is in '\<status\>' on Redmine — should I use that and add the note there?"), then `lwr issue use <id>` followed by the original verb.
- `activeIssueConflict` or `mutexViolation` → block. Ask the user to resolve before any mutation.
- All `null` AND the call didn't 404 → genuinely no active work; ask user for the explicit id.
- Threw `NOT_FOUND` (exit 4) with no Redmine error → both sides truly empty; ask user for the explicit id.

**Verbs that should follow this contract** when the user didn't pass `<id>`: `lwr issue note`, `lwr issue status`, `lwr issue close`, `lwr issue assign`, `lwr time log`, `lwr issue handover`, `lwr issue resolve`. Reading `me.md` instead of calling `issue current` is the bug pattern — don't do it.

---

## ⏳ Freshness contract — never quote stale status

Several JSON envelopes carry an `activeIssue` object describing the sticky issue (`lwr home`, `lwr issue current`). The cached `status` field is a snapshot — it can drift the moment the issue moves on Redmine UI, via another dev's action, or by Redmine workflow. To keep you honest, every such envelope carries a `freshness` label:

```jsonc
"activeIssue": {
  "id": 126208,
  "subject": "Bug — Total Marks Displayed for Failed PG Students",
  "status": "Development in Progress",
  "freshness": "fresh" | "aging" | "stale"
}
```

- `"fresh"` — lwr just verified against Redmine in this command run. Quote `status` confidently.
- `"aging"` — cached 5 min – 2 h ago, no successful refresh. Mention status only if you also say "based on last sync".
- `"stale"` — cached > 2 h ago, or live-refresh failed. **Do not quote `status` as if it were current.** Either omit status, or call `lwr issue view <id> --json` first to confirm.

When a previously-active issue turned out closed in Redmine, the envelope reports it via `activeIssueCleared` and removes the `activeIssue` field entirely — the pointer has been auto-cleared:

```jsonc
"activeIssueCleared": {
  "previousId": 126208,
  "previousSubject": "Bug — Total Marks Displayed for Failed PG Students",
  "currentStatus": "Closed"
},
"activeIssue": null
```

Always relay this to the user. Don't pretend the issue is still active just because you saw it active last turn.

---

## When to use lwr

Use `lwr` whenever the user asks to:

- Find an issue (by id, subject keyword, or full-text search)
- View / show / describe an issue — subject, status, assignee, journal text, list of attachments (no file contents)
- Fetch / analyze / read an issue's attachments — materialise the issue + every attachment to `~/.lwr/issues/<id>/`, with PDF/DOCX rendered to per-page images and XLSX to CSV so you can read them
- List issues assigned to themselves or someone else
- Change an issue's status, assignee, priority, or any field
- Add a note (comment) to an issue
- Close, re-open, or transition an issue
- Create a new issue
- See project members, versions, or metadata
- Resolve a human name → Redmine id (project or user)

**Do NOT use `lwr` for:**

- Wiki pages — `wiki *` verbs do not exist.
- Anything outside Redmine.

---

## 🧠 Cross-agent shared brain — `lwr prefs`

`~/.lwr/facts/preferences.json` is the **single durable home** for user-declared facts that apply across every AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, …). Agents teach lwr via `lwr prefs add` and lwr fires the rule automatically on every subsequent `issue edit | create | status | close` — regardless of which agent runs the command next session.

### The three rules — load-bearing

1. **Never store preference-shaped facts in agent-side memory.** Your own memory (Claude's `memory/`, Codex's equivalent, …) is per-agent and drifts. The only durable place is `~/.lwr/facts/preferences.json` via `lwr prefs add`.
2. **Always quote the user in `--reason`.** When the user later runs `lwr prefs list`, they should recognise their own words and judge whether the rule still applies.
3. **On `VALIDATION_API_REJECTED` with a required-CF error**, first run `lwr prefs list --json`. If a matching rule exists, the apply-path has a bug — report it. If no rule, ask the user *"should this become a default?"* and only then call `prefs add`. Never silently `--cf` and move on.

### Decision tree: fact-shaped statement → what to do

```
User said something that sounds like a preference:
├─ "do X this once" / one-off            → no rule, just execute
├─ "always do X" / "default X" /
│   "when Y, set Z" / "my X is Y"         → `lwr prefs add` BEFORE the action,
│                                           then continue
├─ Correction: "no, not that — set Z"     → `lwr prefs add` with reason quoting
│                                           the correction
└─ Ambiguous / single-instance            → ask once; if user confirms "yes,
                                            always", then `prefs add`
```

### Teaching a rule

```bash
# Resolve cf names + value names via the existing cf-resolver — agents
# can pass either ids or names on both sides.
lwr prefs add \
  --when "Developer=Sibin Baby" \
  --set  "Tester=Alex Biju" \
  --reason "User: my default tester is Alex when I'm the developer" \
  --agent claude-code \
  --json
```

- `--when` is a single condition. `--set` may repeat for multi-cf injection.
- `--reason` and `--agent` are **mandatory in non-TTY** (every agent context). Without them you get `PREFERENCES_REASON_REQUIRED` / `PREFERENCES_AGENT_REQUIRED`.
- `--id` is optional. Default is deterministic: `cf<when>-eq<value>-cf<set>`. Re-teaching the same logical rule is idempotent.

### Reading + removing

- `lwr prefs list --json` — every rule with full provenance (`reason`, `addedBy`, `addedAt`, `lastTriggeredAt`, `triggerCount`).
- `lwr prefs remove <id>` — drop a rule. Cheap; re-add with `prefs add` if the user changes their mind.

### What lwr surfaces when a rule fires

Every `issue edit | create | status | close` that injects a default carries `meta.appliedDefaults[]` in the JSON envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "appliedDefaults": [
      {
        "rule": "cf79-eq57-cf88",
        "cf": 88, "cfName": "Tester",
        "value": 256, "valueLabel": "Alex Biju",
        "reason": "User: my default tester is Alex when I'm the developer",
        "source": "preferences"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Inspect this if the user asks "did you change anything besides what I asked?" — the audit trail is right there.

### Disabling (rare)

The apply-path is on by default. To opt out completely (no preferences fire, no events recorded): `lwr assistant disable`. **The preferences feature stays active even with the assistant disabled — only the events observer is gated on the flag.**

---

## 🧬 Memory — the queryable index over agent activity

lwr maintains a SQLite store at `~/.lwr/memory/memory.db` that grows automatically as the agent works. You don't write to it explicitly — the assistant pipeline does. You **read** it before making fact-shaped decisions.

What gets stored, automatically:

| Kind | Source | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `observation` | every command + every cf change in a mutation | The "what did the user do recently" record. |
| `fact` | every `lwr prefs add` / `prefs remove` (with `rule_id` link + supersession) | The queryable index over `preferences.json`. |
| `rule-candidate` | ≥ 5 user-passed `(cf, value)` mutations in 30 days, with no covering rule | Surfaces patterns lwr would automate if you taught it. |

### The recall-before-write pattern — load-bearing for supersession

When the user states a new fact that might replace an existing one (e.g. *"my new tester will be Maya"*, *"actually I work on AMS V5 now"*), **recall before writing**. This is how lwr handles evolving facts intelligently — same `rule_id` gets updated, history is preserved, and the apply path immediately uses the new value.

```
User: "my new tester will be Maya"
  │
  1. lwr memory recall --kind fact --cf-id 88 --json
  │    → returns the active fact for cf 88 (Tester), if any
  │    → read metadata.rule_id from the result
  │
  2a. If a fact exists:
  │    lwr prefs add --id <existing-rule-id> --when "..." --set "Tester=Maya" \
  │                  --reason "User: my new tester will be Maya" --agent claude-code
  │    → outcome="updated"; old fact auto-superseded; new fact retained
  │
  2b. If no fact exists:
       lwr prefs add --when "..." --set "Tester=Maya" --reason "..." --agent claude-code
       → outcome="added"; fresh rule + fact
```

The supersession is what makes memory feel intelligent — without recall-before-write, you'd end up with two conflicting rules (Tester=Alex *and* Tester=Maya) both sitting in `preferences.json`.

### Recall surfaces

- `lwr memory recall <substring>` — case-insensitive substring match on the `content` column.
- `lwr memory recall --kind fact --cf-id 88` — active fact for a target cf.
- `lwr memory recall --kind fact --rule-id <id>` — active fact for a known rule.
- `lwr memory recall --include-superseded` — full audit history, including superseded rows. Use when the user asks *"who was my tester last quarter?"*.
- `lwr memory recall --kind rule-candidate` — patterns lwr noticed but hasn't been taught. Surface these to the user when you spot them.

### Status + cleanup

- `lwr memory status` — counts per kind, file size, oldest/newest, last-prune timestamp.
- `lwr memory prune` — destructive. Deletes `observation` rows older than 1 year. Facts and rule-candidates are kept. Auto-prune runs once per 24 h on its own; manual prune is for explicit cleanup.

## 🌅 Daily rollover — "did you stop yesterday without pausing?"

Every lwr command runs a quick pre-flight check at the top of the day. If an issue is sitting in a dev-active status (`Development in Progress`, `Dev Analysis In Progress`) AND the last action-log entry is either on a prior calendar day OR more than 4 hours ago, lwr surfaces a structured **`meta.dailyRollover`** signal on the very next command's JSON envelope (and a one-line stderr warning in pretty mode).

This catches the common workflow gap: dev closes the laptop without running `lwr issue pause`, comes back the next morning, and Redmine still shows the issue as in-progress — which would let the next mutex enforcement back-fill the entire overnight gap as work time.

### What you should do when you see `meta.dailyRollover`

The agent (you) drives the conversation; lwr provides the substrate. **Don't ignore the signal** — ask the user, then resolve it.

```
You see: meta.dailyRollover = {
  issueId: 12345,
  issueStatus: "Development in Progress",
  lastActivityAt: "2026-05-22T18:30:00+05:30",
  reason: "date-change",        // or "gap-exceeded"
  gapMs: 50400000,              // 14h
  suggestedAction: "lwr issue handover 12345 --stopped <when>"
}
```

Ask the user something like:

> "I see issue #12345 was still in `Development in Progress` since 2026-05-22 18:30 IST (about 14 hours ago). When did you actually stop working on it? And are you still working on it today or did you wrap up?"

Then call `lwr issue handover` based on their answer:

| User says... | Call |
|---|---|
| "I stopped at 7:30pm yesterday, not continuing today" | `lwr issue handover 12345 --stopped 19:30 --mode pause` |
| "I worked till 8pm; the deploy went out this morning" | `lwr issue handover 12345 --stopped 20:00 --mode resolve` |
| "I'm still on it — just need to backfill yesterday's hours" | `lwr issue handover 12345 --stopped 19:30 --mode resume` |
| "Never mind, I already paused properly in Redmine UI" | `lwr issue handover --dismiss` |

### What `lwr issue handover` actually does

- **Time entry**: POSTs a Redmine time entry covering `[lastActivityAt → --stopped]`. Activity defaults to "Configurations" (team convention); date is the day the work happened.
- **Status change**: PUT to PAUSE_STATUS_NAME / RESOLVED_STATUS_NAME (or no-op for `--mode resume`).
- **Ack marker**: stamps today at `~/.lwr/.rollover-ack` — subsequent commands stay quiet until tomorrow.

### What you should NOT do

- Don't silently auto-pause via `lwr issue pause` without confirming the stop time — you'd lose the time-tracking signal.
- Don't try to dismiss the rollover with `--dismiss` to "move on quickly" without asking. The whole point of the signal is to get the user's input before lwr writes anything.
- Don't fire `handover` once and forget it — verify the JSON envelope reports the expected `timeEntry.hours` (should match `(--stopped - lastActivityAt)` in hours).

## 💾 Backup & restore — `<timestamp>_backup.lwr`

Two verbs around a single bundle format. Bundles live in `~/.lwr/backups/` by default and use the suffix `_backup.lwr` so they're easy for you to pick out by filename.

**Create a snapshot:**

```bash
lwr backup create --json
# → { "path": "~/.lwr/backups/2026-05-23T09-00-00Z_backup.lwr",
#     "fileCount": 42, "sizeBytes": 28147, "createdAt": "..." }
```

**List restore points (newest first):**

```bash
lwr backup list --json
# → { "backups": [ { "name": "...", "kind": "user" | "pre-restore",
#                    "sizeBytes": 28147, "createdAt": "..." }, ... ] }
```

**Restore (destructive — needs the double-confirm gate):**

```bash
lwr restore ~/.lwr/backups/2026-05-23T09-00-00Z_backup.lwr \
  --confirm "restore" --yes --json
```

**Prune old bundles** (destructive; `pre-restore-*` accumulate on every restore):

```bash
lwr backup prune --keep 5 --json                    # default kind=all
lwr backup prune --keep 0 --kind pre-restore --json # wipe every auto-snapshot
```

What a bundle contains:

- Everything under `~/.lwr/` **except** the credentials fallback (`auth.json`) and the `backups/` dir itself.
- Memory DB, action log, feedback log, preferences, caches, materialised issues, config — all in.

What you need to do after restore:

- Run `lwr auth login` in a sidecar terminal — credentials never round-trip through backups (the keychain entry is OS-bound; the `auth.json` fallback is plaintext and intentionally excluded).
- If `lwr` reports `CONFIG_BASE_URL_MISSING`, the bundle came from a fork or pre-bootstrap state — ask the user once, then `lwr config base-url <url>`.

Safety net — every `restore` writes a `pre-restore-<timestamp>_backup.lwr` to the backups directory **before** wiping. If the user says "wrong backup", run `lwr restore <pre-restore-…>` to roll back.

Don't:

- Don't loop `lwr backup create` after every mutation — backups are user-initiated. The auto-snapshot inside `restore` covers the only case where lwr makes one itself.
- Don't try to manually pass `auth.json` content into a bundle. Credentials are out of scope by design.
- Don't pick a backup file by guessing the path. Always `lwr backup list --json` first, then restore by an exact `name` from that list.

---

## Preview before you commit — `--dry-run`

Every mutating verb (anything with `commandMeta.safety: "mutate"` or `"destructive"`) honors a global `--dry-run` flag. With it, the command runs the full pipeline — flag parsing, name resolution, workflow guard, payload assembly — then **stops before the HTTP write** and returns a structured preview instead of the real response.

```jsonc
{
  "schema": "lwr/v1",
  "command": "issue.status",
  "requestId": "…",
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "dry_run": true,
    "method": "PUT",
    "path": "/issues/125415.json",
    "payload": { "issue": { "status_id": 78 } },
    "resolved": {
      "issueId": 125415,
      "status": { "id": 78, "name": "Resolved" },
      "currentStatus": { "id": 72, "name": "Dev Analysis Completed" }
    },
    "guards": ["workflow.allowed_transition"]
  },
  "commandMeta": { "safety": "mutate", "idempotent": true, "network": true }
}
```

**When to use it:**

- **Always for risky mutations the user described in natural language.** "Close issue X as Resolved and assign to Lakshmi" → `--dry-run` first; show the resolved ids/names; ask the user to confirm; re-run without it. The dry-run resolves "Lakshmi" against project members and shows you the exact match — surfaces ambiguity (two Lakshmis) before you mutate the wrong one.
- **Before any `safety: destructive` call.** `time.delete`, `cache.clear`, `auth.logout`, `clear-data`, `uninstall`, `profile.remove` — all support `--dry-run` and run *before* the double-confirm gate, so you can preview without arming the confirmation flow.
- **When chaining multiple mutations.** Dry-run the whole chain first; if any step would fail (workflow guard, name not resolved), you find out before any of them committed.

**When NOT to use it:**

- For commands with `safety: "read"`. `--dry-run` is a silent no-op there — you wasted a call.
- For idempotent re-runs of a successful mutation. If the user asks "do that again to a different issue", just dispatch — the previous call already proved the resolution works.

**Branching contract for agents:** check `data.dry_run === true`. That field is the stable signal — don't infer from the absence of an `id`.

---

## Don't pre-flight

**Skip the warm-up step.** Do not run `lwr auth whoami`, `lwr doctor`, or any "is everything working?" check before the user's actual request. Auth, network, and config problems all surface from the first real call with a stable error code (`AUTH_MISSING`, `AUTH_INVALID`, `NETWORK_*`, `CONFIG_*`) and exit code 2/3/6. Branch on those when they fire — don't burn a round-trip every session checking ahead.

---

## lwr also speaks MCP

Beyond this CLI surface, `lwr serve --mcp` boots an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server over stdio that exposes every verb as an MCP tool plus `lwr://me` as a resource. **You're probably reaching lwr via this skill** — the MCP layer is for agents that don't load skills (Cursor, Cline, ChatGPT desktop, generic MCP clients). Same source of truth (`COMMAND_ANNOTATIONS`), same JSON envelope, same auth, same `requestId` / `commandMeta`. Setup snippet lives in README.md under "MCP setup".

If you're already running this skill, prefer calling `lwr <command> --json` directly — it's lower-latency than going through MCP and the contract is identical.

---

## Discovering commands programmatically

If you ever need to confirm a flag or check whether a verb exists, **call `lwr commands --json`** instead of re-reading SKILL.md. It walks the in-memory command tree (no Redmine round-trip) and returns every leaf verb with full metadata:

```jsonc
{
  "schema": "lwr/v1",
  "command": "commands",
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "totalCommands": 42,
    "globals": [ /* --json, --no-color, --no-interactive, --debug, --silent, --profile, --base-url, --api-key */ ],
    "commands": [
      {
        "name": "issue.list",
        "path": ["issue", "list"],
        "description": "List issues — pass --as <lens> ...",
        "args": [],
        "options": [{ "long": "--project", "argName": "<id>", "description": "Project id or identifier", "required": false, "negate": false }, ...],
        "safety": "read",         // read | mutate | destructive
        "idempotent": true,
        "network": true
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

Filter with `--filter <prefix>` (e.g. `lwr commands --filter time --json`) to get just one subtree. Use this when:

- You want to confirm a flag you remember from this doc actually exists.
- The user asks "what can lwr do for X?" and you'd rather show a structured list than narrate.
- You're chaining multiple verbs and want to verify every step is `safety: read` or `safety: mutate` before kicking off (vs `destructive`, which always needs the user's go-ahead).

`safety: destructive` is the load-bearing flag here — those verbs (`time delete`, `cache clear`, `clear-data`, `uninstall`, `auth logout`, `profile remove`) all require the `--confirm "<action>" --yes` pair in non-TTY contexts. Treat any `destructive` call as "ask the user first" by default.

Only run `whoami` / `doctor` when the user explicitly asks "am I logged in?" / "is lwr working?" / "what's wrong with auth?". Cache warm-up is automatic — the first `--project <name>` populates the index.

---

## Mental model — the resolution spine

Every mutation flows through the same chain. Internalising this means you can compose any operation with one command:

```
issue id  ──►  fetch issue  ──►  project.id  ──►  members[]   (cache-first)
                                              │
                                              ▼
              "Jane Doe"  ──── resolve via members ──►  user_id

issue id  ──►  fetch issue with allowed_statuses  ──►  workflow guard
                                                   │
                                                   ▼
              "New"    ──── resolve via cached statuses dict ──►  status_id
                                                   │
                                                   ▼
              if status_id ∈ allowed_statuses  →  single PUT
                                                else  →  WORKFLOW_NOT_ALLOWED
                                                        with details.allowed[]
```

**What this means for you:**

- Pass human names freely: `--project "Acme Portal V2"`, `--assignee "Jane Doe"`, `--status "Testing Pending"`. The resolver does the rest.
- The issue id is the only key you reliably need. Everything else can be derived.
- Forbidden status transitions are caught client-side. You do not need to call `lwr issue transitions <id>` defensively before every change — only when you want to enumerate options.

## 📋 Rendering issue lists in chat

When you've fetched issues via `lwr issue list --json` (or any other list command) and need to show them to the user, follow these rules. They produce a scannable, clickable result that fits a chat UI — markdown, not vertical paragraph dumps.

### Default format: a markdown table

```markdown
| #ID | Subject | Status | Priority | College | Assignee |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [#125415](https://redmine.example.com/issues/125415) | EPIC - Enhancement in Consolidated Mark Card | Development Completed | Immediate | ACME-WEST | Krishnakumar R |
| [#122047](https://redmine.example.com/issues/122047) | EPIC - Enable Photocopy option for exam Passed Students | Resolved | Immediate | ACME-EAST | Krishnakumar R |
```

### Hard rules

1. **Always link the issue id as markdown.** Use `[#<id>](<url>)`. Each row in `--json` already has a `url` field — use it directly, don't construct it yourself.
2. **Always include the `College` column** for any issue list (when the cf is configured) — every issue carries one, and the value (e.g. `ACME-WEST`, `ACME-EAST`) is a critical disambiguator. If `college` is `null` (rare), render it as `—`.
3. **Use a markdown table** for ≥ 2 rows. A vertical "ID: …, Status: …, Priority: …" layout is harder to scan and breaks side-by-side comparisons.
4. **Cap at ~25 rows** in chat unless the user asked for "all". Beyond that, summarise with counts ("31 issues; top 25 by priority shown — pass --all to dump everything").
5. **Empty/null values render as `—`** (em dash), never as the string `null` or `""`.
6. **Trim long subjects** to fit in a chat-readable column (~50–60 chars). Keep the full text in the link's `title` if your renderer supports it; otherwise just trim.

### Compact view (for one or two issues)

A single-issue answer can use a tighter format:

```markdown
**[#125415](https://redmine.example.com/issues/125415) — EPIC - Enhancement in Consolidated Mark Card**
Status: Development Completed · Priority: Immediate · College: ACME-WEST · Assignee: Krishnakumar R
```

### What NOT to do

- ❌ ASCII boxes, dividers like `────`, or vertical "key: value" blocks per row. Chat renders markdown — use it.
- ❌ Bare numeric IDs (`125415`) without the link. The whole point of carrying `url` in the JSON is so you can link it.
- ❌ Custom column ordering. Default order: **#ID · Subject · Status · Priority · College · Assignee**. Change only if the user explicitly asks for a different angle.
- ❌ Reformatting `lwr`'s pretty-mode output. You're calling with `--json` — don't try to massage the human-table output, you'll lose data and waste tokens.

### Closing summary line

After the table, add a one-liner with totals + a useful next-step prompt:

> 8 issues, 3 Resolved · 3 Development Completed · 1 Testing completed · 1 Paused. Want me to drill into any of these, or filter to just open ones?

Keep it short. One sentence.

## ✏️ Pre-resolve typos with your reasoning, not lwr's resolver

The lwr resolver is exact-match (case-insensitive) plus substring. It does **not** correct misspellings. `"Sibn"`, `"Krisnakumar"`, `"Tesing Pending"`, `"Linwys AMS V4"` will all fail with `*_NOT_FOUND` even though a human reader can see the intent.

**Don't** rely on "fail then recover" — your reasoning is the typo-correction layer. Pre-resolve names against the cached candidate pool **before** the first mutation:

| User mentions | Cache to consult | Command |
|---|---|---|
| A person (`--assignee "Sibn"`) | per-project members | `lwr user list --project <id> --json` |
| A project (`--project "Linwys AMS"`) | projects index | `lwr project list --all --json` |
| A status (`--status "Tesing Pending"`) | instance statuses | `lwr status list --json` |
| A sprint (`--sprint "Sprnt93"`) | per-project versions | `lwr project versions <id> --json` |

All four are **cache hits** after login (login prefetches members for every project the user is in, plus the statuses dict and projects index). The list calls are essentially free.

**Workflow:**

```bash
# User says: "assign 122047 to Jne"

# 1. Pull the candidate pool — cache hit, no Redmine call
lwr user list --project 51 --json   # 51 = active project from me.md

# 2. Read the response. Reason: "Jne" + project members
#    → obvious typo for "Jane Doe" (id 57). One-char delete.

# 3. Use the resolved numeric id, not the user's spelling
lwr issue edit 122047 --assignee-id 57 --notes "kicking off" --json
```

**Why id > exact name:** even if you've corrected the typo, passing `--assignee 57` is one fewer thing for lwr to look up. The resolver only runs when the agent passes a name; using the numeric id bypasses it entirely.

**When to skip pre-resolution:** if you're highly confident the user's spelling is correct (they pasted the exact name from a previous result, or it's a name you've seen them use before in this session), call directly with the name. The resolver handles exact + substring fine. **The pre-resolution step is for ambiguity / low-confidence inputs**, not every call.

If the resolver does fail on a low-confidence attempt, the error envelope's `error.details.candidates` carries the same pool — you can recover from there. But the upfront read is cheaper than a failed mutation + a list + a retry.

## Output contract (`schema: lwr/v1`)

**Success:**

```json
{
  "schema": "lwr/v1",
  "command": "issue.view",
  "ok": true,
  "data": { /* command-specific payload */ }
}
```

**Failure:**

```json
{
  "schema": "lwr/v1",
  "command": "issue.edit",
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "WORKFLOW_NOT_ALLOWED",
    "message": "Status 3 is not an allowed transition from \"Development Completed\".",
    "hint": "Allowed transitions: \"Testing Pending\" (9), \"Closed\" (5). Run `lwr issue transitions 122591`.",
    "details": {
      "issueId": 122591,
      "currentStatus": { "id": 39, "name": "Development Completed" },
      "requestedStatusId": 3,
      "allowed": [{"id": 9, "name": "Testing Pending", "is_closed": false}, ...]
    }
  }
}
```

Branch on `error.code`. Read `error.details` for structured recovery payloads — the data you need to retry is **already there**; do not re-fetch.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 0 | ok |
| 2 | auth (401 / 403 / missing key) |
| 3 | network |
| 4 | not found |
| 5 | server (5xx) |
| 6 | config |
| 7 | validation (bad/missing flag, 422, name not resolved, workflow blocked) |
| 10 | internal bug |

### Error codes reference

| Code | When | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_MISSING` | No API key configured | Tell the user to run `lwr auth login` |
| `AUTH_INVALID` | 401 — key rejected | Same |
| `AUTH_FORBIDDEN` | 403 — account lacks permission | Suggest a role/permission change in Redmine; for `/users.json` specifically, fall back to `lwr user list --project <id>` |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Verify the id; for stale projects, `lwr cache refresh --type projects` |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | Wait, retry once |
| `VALIDATION_MISSING_FLAG` | Required flag absent | Read the `hint`, pass the named flag |
| `VALIDATION_BAD_VALUE` | Bad value | Read the `hint` |
| `VALIDATION_API_REJECTED` | Redmine 422 (e.g., custom field required) | Read `error.message` for the Redmine-side reason |
| `VALIDATION_USER_NOT_FOUND` | No user matched the name | Try `lwr user list --project <id>` to see who's on the project; or `lwr user import` for a manual fallback |
| `VALIDATION_AMBIGUOUS_USER` | Multiple users matched | Read `error.details.candidates`, pick one, retry with the numeric id |
| `VALIDATION_PROJECT_NOT_FOUND` | No project matched | Run `lwr project list --all --json` to see what's visible; or `lwr cache refresh --type projects` if a new project was just created |
| `VALIDATION_AMBIGUOUS_PROJECT` | Multiple projects matched | Read `error.details.candidates`, pick one, retry with id or identifier |
| `VALIDATION_CF_NOT_FOUND` | `--cf <name>=…` name not in catalog | Read `error.details.known[]` (most-recent first), pick a name or use the numeric id. Catalog is empty? Fetch any issue first to seed it. |
| `VALIDATION_AMBIGUOUS_CF` | Multiple catalog entries with the same cf name | Pass the numeric id from `error.details.candidates[]`. |
| `WORKFLOW_NOT_ALLOWED` | Target status not in allowed_statuses | Pick from `error.details.allowed[]` and retry |
| `PREFERENCES_PARSE_ERROR` | `~/.lwr/facts/preferences.json` is malformed | Read `error.message`; fix or `rm` the file (warn-only on load, fatal on `prefs add/remove`) |
| `PREFERENCES_SCHEMA_MISMATCH` | File uses a future schema version | Use a newer `lwr`; warn-only on load |
| `PREFERENCES_DUPLICATE_RULE_ID` | Two rules share an `id` | First wins on load; fatal on `prefs add` — `lwr prefs remove <id>` first or pick a new `--id` |
| `PREFERENCES_RULE_NOT_FOUND` | `lwr prefs remove <id>` with unknown id | Run `lwr prefs list --json` first; `error.details.known[]` lists the valid ids |
| `PREFERENCES_REASON_REQUIRED` | `lwr prefs add` in non-TTY without `--reason` | Pass `--reason "<quote user>"` |
| `PREFERENCES_AGENT_REQUIRED` | `lwr prefs add` in non-TTY without `--agent` | Pass `--agent <claude-code|codex|copilot|…>` |
| `TUI_REQUIRES_TTY` | Tried to launch dash from a pipe | Don't — agents never launch the TUI |

For deeper recovery patterns per code (cache staleness retry policy, role-mismatch flow, the full `error.details.cache` contract), see [`recipes/error-recovery.md`](recipes/error-recovery.md).

## Decision trees

### "Find an issue X"

```
Do you know the numeric id?
├─ yes  →  pick the verb based on what the user is asking for:
│            ├─ view / show / describe / "what's the status of" / "who's on"
│            │    →  lwr issue view <id> --json
│            │       (cheap; no attachment download; no on-disk copy)
│            │
│            └─ analyze / review / read the attached / summarize the PDF /
│               "understand the issue fully" / "fetch the issue and its files"
│                 →  lwr issue fetch <id> --json
│                    (materialises issue + attachments to ~/.lwr/issues/<id>/;
│                     PDF/DOCX → per-page PNGs, XLSX → CSV; safe to re-run —
│                     skips cached files unless --force)
│
└─ no   →  lwr search "<keywords>" --types issue --json
              data.results[].ref is "#<id>"; strip the # and use it.
              For multiple matches, pick the one whose subject best matches.
              Then re-enter this tree (view vs fetch) with the resolved id.
```

**Rule of thumb:** if the next step is *reading the contents of an attached file*, use `fetch`. If the next step is *answering a question about the issue's metadata or text*, use `view`. Don't `fetch` speculatively — it does real work (downloads, conversions).

### "What am I working on RIGHT NOW?" / "What's active?"

Two answers exist — pick by intent:

| User intent | Command | What it reads |
|---|---|---|
| "what did I tell lwr I'm on?" (stable, fast, offline) | `lwr issue current --json` | local profile config — last `lwr issue use <id>` |
| "what is Redmine saying I'm actively working on?" (truth, live) | `lwr issue active --json` | live `cf_<dev>=<me> & status_id in (Development in Progress)` (plus "Dev Analysis in Progress" when that status gets added; "Dev Analysis required" is a *queue* state, not active) |

**Note: only one issue may sit in active dev statuses at a time per developer.** The mutex is enforced **automatically** by lwr: whenever a status PUT lands an issue in `DEV_ACTIVE_STATUS_NAMES` (today: `Development in Progress`, `Dev Analysis In Progress`), every *other* issue currently sitting in any dev-active status for cf-79=me is auto-PUT → "Paused". This applies regardless of which verb made the PUT (`issue.status`, `issue.edit --status`). For all other destinations (Paused, Resolved, Closed, Re-Opened, etc.) the mutex is a no-op. `lwr issue active --json` returns `invariantViolated: true` if more than one matches — in that case ask the user which one to keep and pause the others (`lwr issue pause --status "Paused"`). Use `active` over `current` when the answer needs to reflect what Redmine actually says, not local state.

### "Issues ready to push to production" / "what's ready to resolve" / "deploy queue"

this workflow: **"Resolved" = deployed to production** (not "dev done"). When QA finishes, the issue lands in "Testing completed" — that's the queue of pending deploys on the developer's plate.

```
lwr issue list --as developer --status 43 --json    # 43 = "Testing completed"
```

(Status names → ids live in `~/.lwr/cache/statuses.json` — `lwr cache list statuses` to inspect. The id can drift across Redmine forks; the **name** "Testing completed" is the human contract.)

### "Deploy / resolve / push to production" — `lwr issue resolve`

When the user says "resolve #X", "I deployed #X", "push #X to prod", or "move #X to resolved":

```
lwr issue resolve <id> --spent 10m --json
```

What this does:
1. PUTs `<id>` to "Resolved".
2. POSTs a time entry (default activity "Configurations" — the closest fit in this workflow since there's no "Deployment" activity). Omit `--spent` to skip the time entry.
3. Clears the active pointer iff `<id>` was the pointer (you finished what you were on).

**No auto-pause:** "Resolved" isn't in `DEV_ACTIVE_STATUS_NAMES`, so the dev-active mutex doesn't fire here. Your previous active issue (if any) keeps ticking through the brief deploy — acceptable per "deploys are real-time, single-digit minute interrupts". If a future "Deployment in Progress" status is added to the workflow, transitioning through it would correctly fire the mutex sweep and give per-deploy time boundaries automatically.

**`lwr issue resolve` has no `--date` flag — and intentionally so.** A resolve is a *real-time deploy action*: the status PUT is always "now" (Redmine doesn't backdate status changes), and deploys are typically 5–15 min logged at the moment they happen. If the user says "I forgot to log yesterday's work on this issue" (long-running dev work that crossed days, not a deploy), that's a different workflow — use `lwr time log <id> --hours <N> --date <YYYY-MM-DD> --activity <name>`, which is purpose-built for backfilling.

The agent picks `--spent` from conversation cues (deploy mentioned 10 min ago → `--spent 10m`). Realistic range for a single resolve is **5m / 10m / 15m**; if the user mentioned a longer deploy, pass `30m` / `1h` / `1h30m`. If ambiguous, ask the user — don't guess.

Single-id per call (no bulk). For a run of resolves:
```
lwr issue resolve 125358 --spent 10m --json
lwr issue resolve 125724 --spent 15m --json
# Pointer still points at the originally-active issue (now Paused).
# Ask user: "back to #<original-id>?" → on confirm:
lwr issue status <original-id> "Development in Progress" --json
```

Use `--dry-run` to preview the PUT + POST without committing.

### "What's on my plate?" / "My issues" / "My work"

Read `~/.lwr/me.md` first to know the user's roles, then pick the lens from the question's intent (see the lens table at the top). For an ambiguous "my plate" question:

- **Single-role profile** → use that role's lens (e.g. `--as developer`).
- **Multi-role profile** → ask the user which lens, or use `--as any`.

```
# Single-role developer:
lwr issue list --as developer --status open --json

# Multi-role, union view:
lwr issue list --as any --json

# Filters compose normally:
#   --status <id-or-name>   open / In Progress / etc.
#   --priority <id>         High / Urgent
#   --project <name-or-id>
#   --tracker <id>
#   --subject <text>        substring match
#   --sort <spec>           "priority:desc,updated_on:desc" (default)
#   --limit <n>             defaults to 25
#   --all                   fetch every page

# Built-in lenses bypass the profile:
lwr issue list --as assignee --json    # assigned_to_id=<userId>
lwr issue list --as reporter --json    # author_id=<userId>
```

`--as` and `--assignee` are mutually exclusive — pick one. `--as` reads the user's id from `me.md`; `--assignee <id>` is for "who else's plate," not yours.

### Picking the right `--sort` for "new to old" / "by sprint" / "due soon"

Redmine has six temporal axes on every issue. The right sort depends on the **intent** of "new to old" — pick by the question, don't blindly default. All of these work today via `--sort` (no special flag needed):

| User says | `--sort` value | What it actually means |
|---|---|---|
| "newest first / latest" / "by activity" / *no temporal hint* | `priority:desc,updated_on:desc` *(default — last-touched first)* | Most-recent action of any kind: comment, status change, field edit. |
| "newest issues" / "most recently created" / "freshly assigned" | `created_on:desc` | When the ticket was first opened. Ignores re-opens and edits. |
| "by sprint, latest first" / "current sprint work" | `fixed_version:desc,priority:desc` | Sprint id descending. Note: sprint ids increment over time, so latest sprint is at the top. The agent can group results client-side using `fixed_version.name`. |
| "due soonest" / "what's running out of time" | `due_date:asc` *(filter to open statuses)* | Hard deadline. Open issues with the earliest `due_date` first. |
| "started recently" | `start_date:desc` | When work officially began (often = sprint start). |
| "recently closed / shipped" | `closed_on:desc` *(filter to closed statuses)* | When the ticket was resolved. |

**Every issue payload already carries the data** — `fixed_version.{id, name}`, `created_on`, `updated_on`, `due_date`, `start_date`, `closed_on`. No extra fetches needed; sort client-side or via Redmine's sort param.

Composability:

```bash
# "List my latest assigned tickets, newest first"
lwr issue list --as developer --sort created_on:desc --json

# "What sprint am I working on right now?" — top result's fixed_version is the answer.
lwr issue list --as developer --sort fixed_version:desc --limit 5 --json

# "What's due this week, sorted by deadline?"
lwr issue list --as developer --status open --sort due_date:asc --json
```

> **Default sort is correct for triage** ("show me what to look at first" — high priority + recent activity). Override only when the user's question implies a different temporal axis.

### "Issues in sprint X" / "issues from may 6" / "may first week sprint"

When the user names a sprint by **a date** ("issues from may 6"), **a date range** ("may first week"), or **a sprint name** ("Sprint93"), the agent resolves which sprint they mean and filters via `--sprint`.

**Step 1 — fetch the project's versions** (cheap, one HTTP call, cacheable):

```bash
lwr project versions <projectId> --json
```

Each version has `id`, `name` (e.g. `"Sprint93 - May4 - May9"`), `status` (`open` | `locked` | `closed`), and `dueDate`. **The naming convention encodes both start and end dates in `name`** (the API doesn't expose `startDate` separately) — parse them from the name with a regex like:

```
/^Sprint\d+\s*-\s*([A-Za-z]+\d+)\s*-\s*([A-Za-z]+\d+)$/
# group 1 = start label, group 2 = end label (e.g. "May4" / "May9")
```

**Step 2 — match the user's reference:**

| User says | Match logic |
|---|---|
| `"Sprint93"` (exact or partial name) | `--sprint Sprint93` (lwr handles substring) |
| A specific date, e.g. `"may 6"` (no year → assume the most recent year with sprints) | Find the version whose `[startDate, dueDate]` range contains the date. |
| A range, e.g. `"may first week"` | Resolve to `[May 1, May 7]`. Pick the version with the **most overlap** with that range. If two are roughly equal, ask the user. |
| `"current sprint"` / `"this sprint"` | Status = `open` AND today is between start and dueDate. If multiple match, prefer the one whose name contains the highest sprint number. |
| `"last sprint"` | Status = `closed` (or `locked`) AND most-recently ended (highest `dueDate`). |

**Step 3 — issue the filter:**

```bash
lwr issue list --as developer --sprint <id-or-name> --json
```

Use the resolved version's `id` for an unambiguous query, or the exact `name` (lwr will resolve it again — same result, slightly more network).

**Concrete example — "list my issues in sprint of may 6":**

```bash
# 1. Discover sprint
lwr project versions 51 --json
# (agent parses each name; finds "Sprint93 - May4 - May9" — May 6 falls inside [May 4, May 9])

# 2. Filter
lwr issue list --as developer --sprint 1053 --json
```

**No-year handling:** if the user gives a date without a year, default to the most recent year that has a sprint covering that date. Don't ask unless multiple years tie (rare).

### "Issues where someone else is the developer / tester / etc."

The lens system is logged-in-user-only by design (it reads `me.md`). For "who else" queries, use the generic cf escape hatch with the explicit cf id from `me.md` plus the other person's user id:

```
lwr issue list --cf 79=<otherUserId> --json
```

Resolve `<otherUserId>` first via `lwr user resolve "<Name>" --project <id> --json`.

### "Assign X to Y, set status to Z"

```
single command:
  lwr issue edit <id> --assignee "Y" --status "Z" --notes "<context>" --json

This:
  1. resolves Y via the issue's project members (cache-first)
  2. resolves Z via the cached statuses dictionary
  3. preflights the workflow guard
  4. issues a single PUT

If WORKFLOW_NOT_ALLOWED fires:
  → read error.details.allowed[]
  → either pick a valid status from there, or tell the user the transition isn't permitted
```

### "Set <role-cf> = <person>" (Tester, Developer, Assigned Team, …)

Note: most role assignments live on **custom fields**, not the `assigned_to` field. Use `--cf <name-or-id>=<value>` on `issue edit` / `issue create`. The flag is repeatable, and values that look like names are auto-resolved against the issue's project members.

```
# Set Tester by name — cf name and user both resolved:
lwr issue edit 124847 --cf "Tester=Alex Biju" --json

# Set multiple cfs in one PUT (single journal entry, one round-trip):
lwr issue edit 124847 \
  --cf "Developer=Sibin C" \
  --cf "Tester=Alex Biju" \
  --cf "Assigned Team=Mobile" --json

# Escape hatches for ambiguous values:
lwr issue edit 124847 --cf "Tester=42"                  # raw user id
lwr issue edit 124847 --cf "88=42"                      # raw cf id + raw value
lwr issue edit 124847 --cf "Module=raw:Alex Biju"       # force literal string
```

**How resolution works:**

- **Key**: integer → cf id directly. Otherwise looked up in `~/.lwr/cache/custom-fields.json`, which is built opportunistically from every issue payload that flows through `lwr`. If the catalog is empty, fetch any issue first (e.g. `lwr issue view <id> --json`) — that records the cf names for future calls.
- **Value**: integer → passed through. Otherwise run through the user resolver against the issue's project (same chain `--assignee` uses); falls back to a literal string if no user matched.

**Error codes you'll see:**

| Code | Meaning | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_CF_NOT_FOUND` | cf name isn't in the catalog yet | Read `error.details.known[]` for the names we *do* know; pick one, or pass the numeric id (`--cf 88=…`). If `known` is empty, fetch an issue first to seed the catalog. |
| `VALIDATION_AMBIGUOUS_CF` | rare — multiple catalog entries with the same name | Pass the numeric id from `error.details.candidates[]`. |
| `VALIDATION_AMBIGUOUS_USER` | value resolution hit multiple users | Read `error.details.candidates[]`, retry with `--cf "<cf>=<userId>"`. |

**Don't** pass `--cf` for the *standard* assignee — use `--assignee`. `--cf` is strictly for custom fields.

### "Close issue X"

```
lwr issue close <id> --note "<context>" --json
# uses the first allowed closed status. To pick a specific one (Rejected, Resolved):
lwr issue close <id> --as "Rejected" --note "..." --json
```

### "Add a comment / note"

```
lwr issue note <id> --message "..." --json
# multi-line:
echo "long note" | lwr issue note <id> --message-file - --json
```

**Wrap structured content in fenced code blocks.** Redmine renders triple-backtick fences with language hints, so use them — never just dump raw SQL/JSON/shell into `--message`. When the user's note content is recognisable as code, prose-wrap it yourself before calling `lwr`:

| User said | What to send |
|---|---|
| `add note select * from studentaccount` | ` ```sql\nselect * from studentaccount\n``` ` |
| `add note { "user": 57 }` | ` ```json\n{ "user": 57 }\n``` ` |
| `add note for i in 1..5; do echo $i; done` | ` ```sh\nfor i in 1..5; do echo $i; done\n``` ` |
| `add a stack trace: TypeError…` | ` ```\nTypeError…\n``` ` (no language; plain monospace) |
| `add note "let's discuss tomorrow"` | `let's discuss tomorrow` (prose, no wrap) |

Languages Redmine recognises: `sql`, `json`, `sh` / `bash`, `js`, `ts`, `py`, `php`, `rb`, `yml` / `yaml`, `xml`, `html`, `css`, `diff`, `txt`. Unknown languages fall back to plain monospace — when in doubt, drop the hint and use a bare ` ``` ` fence.

Mixed content (prose intro + a code block + closing line) is fine — wrap *only* the code:

```
The query that failed:

```sql
select * from studentaccount where joined_on > current_date - 30
```

Returns 0 rows on prod, expected ~120.
```

For multi-line content, use `--message-file -` and pipe stdin; the message-as-flag form gets ugly with embedded newlines.

### "Create a new issue"

```
lwr issue create \
  --project "<name-or-id>" \
  --subject "..." \
  --description-file <path-or -> \
  --tracker-id <n>            # optional
  --priority-id <n>           # optional
  --assignee "<Name>"         # resolved against the project's members
  --json
```

`--assignee` resolves against the target project's members (cache-first),
then `/users.json`, then the manual list — same chain as `issue edit`.
Pass `--assignee-id <n>` if you already have the numeric id; passing both
fails with `VALIDATION_BAD_VALUE`.

### "Who is X?" / "What is the id of project Y?"

```
lwr user resolve "X" --issue <id> --json     # uses issue's project members
lwr user resolve "X" --project <name-or-id> --json
lwr project resolve "Y" --json               # name or slug or id
```

### "What can I move this issue to?"

```
lwr issue transitions <id> --json
# returns: { issueId, currentStatus: {id,name}, allowed: [{id,name,isClosed}] }
```

### "What statuses exist on this Redmine?"

```
lwr status list --json
# returns the full instance dictionary (id ↔ name ↔ is_closed)
```

### Time tracking — log / list / edit / delete

When the user logs hours, lists their time, edits an entry, or deletes one, see [`recipes/time-tracking.md`](recipes/time-tracking.md). It covers the four verbs (`lwr time log/list/edit/delete`), activity resolution, hour formats, and the deletion-safety contract.

## Action audit log — what lwr did today

lwr appends one NDJSON line per mutating command to `~/.lwr/log/<date>.ndjson`. Each line is observed (timestamped when the command completed), not inferred. The file is a record of what really happened — `issue.resolve`s, status flips, time entries, prefs adds, the full chain.

| Need | Command |
|---|---|
| "show me everything lwr did today / yesterday / on <date>" | `lwr log show [--today \| --yesterday \| --date YYYY-MM-DD] --json` |
| cleanup old day files | `lwr log clear --before YYYY-MM-DD` |

**Pause vs clear — pick the right verb:**

| User says | Verb |
|---|---|
| "pause this" / "taking a break" / "stopping for now, might come back" | `lwr issue pause --status "Paused" --json` (PUTs Redmine → Paused; pointer stays set) |
| "I'm done" / "wrapping up" / "stopping, no follow-up" | `lwr issue clear --json` (unsets the pointer; no Redmine touch) |
| "switching to #Y" | `lwr issue use Y --json` (auto-pauses prior, sets pointer to Y) |

---

## Common end-to-end patterns

For copy-pasteable workflows that combine multiple verbs (assign + status + comment, triage view, attach + note in one PUT, materialise an issue locally, cross-resource search), see [`recipes/common-patterns.md`](recipes/common-patterns.md).

---

## Cache awareness

```text
~/.lwr/cache/
├── statuses.json           — instance status dict (TTL 24h)
├── activities.json         — time-entry activity dict (TTL 24h)
├── projects-index.json     — id ↔ identifier ↔ name (TTL 24h)
├── projects/<pid>.json     — { project, members[] } (TTL 1h)
└── users-manual.json       — manual fallback list (sacred — not auto-overwritten)
```

**You do not manage the cache.** It populates automatically on first read. If you suspect staleness:

```bash
lwr cache list --json                    # what's cached + ages
lwr cache refresh --type projects        # re-pull index + every cached project
lwr cache refresh                        # re-pull statuses + activities + projects
lwr cache clear   --type projects        # nuke and re-fetch on next call
```

Never `cache clear --type users` unless explicitly asked — the manual fallback list is user-curated.

---

## Troubleshooting & self-recovery

Three commands form the recovery toolkit. Use them in this order when something feels off.

### `lwr skill-paths --json` — "where does everything live?"

Pure read, no network. Reports the canonical `SKILL.md` and `recipes/` paths plus per-tool symlink state. **Run this first** when symlinks seem broken or when you're on an unsupported host and need to know where to read the skill from.

```jsonc
{
  "data": {
    "skill": "/home/<user>/.lwr/skill/SKILL.md",
    "skillExists": true,
    "recipes": "/home/<user>/.lwr/skill/recipes",
    "recipesExists": true,
    "recipeFiles": ["common-patterns.md", "error-recovery.md", "time-tracking.md"],
    "tools": [
      { "name": "Claude Code", "skillFolder": "...", "installed": true, "linked": true },
      { "name": "Codex CLI", ..., "installed": false, "linked": false },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

If `linked: false` for a tool that's `installed: true`, the symlinks under that tool's folder are missing or stale — recover with `lwr update-skill`.

### `lwr update-skill` — "repair the four supported tools"

For Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Codex CLI, and Gemini Antigravity: re-snapshots the canonical and re-creates every symlink. Idempotent. Safe to run any time.

### `lwr install-skill --target <dir>` — "install into one specific folder"

For unsupported hosts (Kilo, Continue, Cursor, future tools) or to install into a non-standard location. Only writes under `$HOME` — refuses paths outside with `VALIDATION_BAD_VALUE`. Touches only the named target — never the four supported tools.

```bash
# Kilo:
lwr install-skill --target ~/.kilo/skills/lw-redmine --json

# Cursor (hypothetical convention):
lwr install-skill --target ~/.cursor/skills/lw-redmine --json
```

### `lwr update` — "update lwr itself"

Distinct from the three above (which only touch the skill bundle): `lwr update` updates the **binary** + skill in one shot. Delegates to `node <repo>/install.mjs update`: git pull → npm install → build → npm link → skill snapshot. Slow, hits the network. Only run when the user explicitly asks for an upgrade — not as a recovery step.

### Recovery scenarios

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Recipe path returns "file not found" | Read the canonical at `~/.lwr/skill/recipes/<name>.md` directly; then run `lwr update-skill` to repair the symlinks. |
| `~/.lwr/skill/SKILL.md` itself is missing | The user hasn't installed lwr — direct them to `node /path/to/lw-redmine/install.mjs install` (see the Install section above). |
| Running on a host without auto-loading | Run `lwr skill-paths --json`, read the `skill` and recipe files directly from your file-read tool. To make it stick for future sessions, run `lwr install-skill --target <your-host's-skill-folder>`. |
| All four supported tools have `linked: false` | Run `lwr update-skill --json` once. Restores everything. |
| `WORKFLOW_NOT_ALLOWED` / cache-staleness errors | These are *Redmine-side* issues, not skill-bundle issues — see `recipes/error-recovery.md`. |

---

## 🛑 Bail-fast contract — don't go off-piste

lwr is in beta. Every time you, the agent, paper over a missing verb or flag with
cleverness, the maintainer never finds out the gap exists. So:

If the user's request can't be satisfied in **≤ 2 commands** from `lwr commands --json`,
**stop**. Do not:

- Read `~/.lwr/config.json`, `~/.lwr/cache/*`, or any other lwr internal state to
  work around a missing feature.
- Construct raw `curl` or HTTP calls to Redmine.
- Read lwr's source to find an undocumented flag.
- Chain three or more commands together to fake a missing verb.

Instead, do this exact sequence:

1. Run:
   ```bash
   lwr feedback log \
     --kind gap \
     --query "<user's exact words>" \
     --reason "<which verb or flag is missing, in one sentence>" \
     --command "<closest existing verb, e.g. issue.edit>" \
     --attempt "ran lwr issue edit --help|no --cf flag found" \
     --attempt "considered raw curl|stopped per contract" \
     [--issue <id>]
   ```
   `--attempt` is repeatable. Format: `<action>|<outcome>`. Pass one
   `--attempt` per step you considered before bailing. Even if you bailed
   immediately, log at least one (`--attempt "checked lwr commands|no verb covers intent|no further steps"`).
2. Reply to the user, verbatim: *"That isn't supported by lwr's current verbs.
   Feedback logged — your maintainer will see it in the weekly batch."*
3. **Stop the turn.** Don't suggest workarounds. Don't propose UI steps. Don't
   chain a different lwr command "while you're at it". The point of bailing is to
   surface the gap cleanly.

### What counts as a gap (bail)

- User says "set Tester to Alex" but `issue.edit` has no `--cf` setter.
- User asks to "rename a sprint" but no `project.versions edit` verb exists.
- User asks for "issues sorted by a field" that `--sort` doesn't accept.

### What does NOT count as a gap (don't bail; recover)

- Workflow guard rejection (`WORKFLOW_NOT_ALLOWED`) — the verb exists. Pick from
  `error.details.allowed[]`.
- Cache staleness — refresh and retry once.
- Typo in a name — pre-resolve via the candidate pool (`user list`, `project
  versions`, etc.).
- Auth/network errors — those are environmental; tell the user to fix and retry.

---

## Hard rules

1. **Always `--json`.** Pretty mode is unstable.
2. **Branch on `error.code`, not `error.message`.** Messages are human-readable and can change.
3. **Read `error.details` before re-fetching.** The data is there.
4. **Pass names, not ids, when the user gives names.** The resolver is faster (cached) and clearer than asking the user for an id.
5. **Never call the TUI** (`lwr dash`) — it requires a TTY and will error out cleanly, but it's wasted effort.
6. **Never bypass the workflow guard.** If `WORKFLOW_NOT_ALLOWED` fires, the transition is genuinely forbidden — pick from `details.allowed[]` or tell the user.
7. **No live mutations to confirm a guard fires.** Verify negative cases by reading the code or by structured `--help`, not by firing a known-bad PUT.
8. **Never pre-flight auth.** Skip `lwr auth whoami` and `lwr doctor` unless the user explicitly asks. Auth/network/config failures surface from the first real command with a stable error code; the round-trip is wasted otherwise.
9. **Read `~/.lwr/me.md` before interpreting "me / my".** Without it, "my issues" defaults to `assigned_to`, which is often the requestor on this workflow — not the implementer. The role lens (`--as <role>`) is what makes the answer correct.
10. **`lwr auth login` is the *only* setup the user runs.** It also builds the `me` block as a side effect (identity + roles + cf bindings). Never instruct the user to run `lwr me detect` themselves — that's an escape hatch the agent invokes when needed (wrong role detected, role added later). The contract: install + login = fully ready.

Run `lwr <command> --help` for the full flag list of any verb.

**Global flags** (work on every command): `--json`, `--no-color`, `--no-interactive`, `--debug`, `--silent`, `--profile <name>`, `--base-url <url>`, `--api-key <key>`, `--dry-run`. Mutating commands honor `--dry-run`; read commands silently ignore it.
