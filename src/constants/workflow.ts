/**
 * Developer workflow — status constants.
 *
 * The Redmine status NAMES that lwr commands key off when reasoning about
 * developer activity. Names match this Redmine instance's status dictionary
 * exactly (see `~/.lwr/cache/statuses.json`) and are resolved to ids at
 * runtime via `resolveStatusId` so a fork pointing at a different Redmine
 * instance only needs to edit this file.
 *
 * Why names and not ids: ids are instance-fragile (the same status can have
 * a different id on a different Redmine deployment). The name is the human
 * contract — "Resolved" means "deployed to production" in this
 * workflow, regardless of which integer id the database assigned it.

/**
 * Statuses where a developer is **actively spending hands-on time** on an

 * at most ONE issue may sit in any of these for a given developer at a
 * time. Moving an issue INTO any of these triggers the mutex enforcement
 * sweep on all other issues that already sit in this set for the same dev.
 *
 * Notably absent:
 * - "Dev Analysis required" — that's a *queue* state ("dev needs to
 *   look at this"), not active work. The dev hasn't engaged yet.
 * - "Development Completed", "Testing completed", "Dev Analysis
 *   Completed" — *waiting* states, not active work.
 * - "Testing in progress" — that's the QA mutex set, not dev.
 *
 * Extend this array to bring more "<phase> in Progress" states under the
 * mutex (e.g., a future "Deployment in Progress" status would slot in
 * here so a deploy interrupt auto-pauses the prior dev work).
