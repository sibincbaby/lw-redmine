/**
 * Sticky `activeIssue` pointer — sync + refresh helpers.
 *
 * The pointer at `~/.lwr/config.json#profiles.<name>.activeIssue` is a
 * snapshot, not a live feed. It's set by `lwr issue use` and used by
 * `lwr issue current`, `lwr home`, the daily-rollover detector and
 * `me.md`. Three flavours of staleness this module exists to prevent:
 *
 *   - lwr-driven mutation that doesn't echo into the pointer.
 *   - status change made via the Redmine web UI (or another tool).
 *   - issue closed/resolved externally → pointer keeps reporting it
 *     as in-progress.
 *
 * The fix is layered:
 *
 *   1. `syncActiveIssueFromPayload()` — call after any successful PUT
 *      that returned a fresh RedmineIssue. Auto-clears when the issue's
 *      status is in `EFFECTIVELY_DONE_STATUS_NAMES` (the canonical
 *      terminal-status set — `closed_on` is unreliable because Redmine
 *      doesn't clear it on reopen). Used by every mutating verb.
 *
 *   2. `liveRefreshActiveIssue()` — best-effort GET used by display
 *      surfaces (`home`, `issue current`). Swallow network failures
 *      and return a freshness verdict so the caller can fall back to
 *      cached + a stale marker.
 *
 *   3. `freshnessOf()` — pure timestamp → label. Cheap, lets every
 *      JSON envelope advertise how trustworthy its `status` is.
 *
 * Both sync helpers also rewrite `me.md` so the rendered identity
 * snippet stays in sync with the pointer.
