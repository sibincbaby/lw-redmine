/**
 * Per-user "who am I" profile.
 *
 * `buildMeProfile` produces a complete `Me` block from a freshly-authenticated
 * Redmine session: identity from `users/current.json`, every cf-backed role
 * the user appears in across recent history, and the Redmine-instance-specific
 * custom field ids that back each role.
 *
 * The model has no "primary role." A user can simultaneously be a developer
 * on issue X, a tester on issue Y, and a lead on issue Z. Every role with
 * enough history lands in `me.roles[]`. The agent picks the right lens at
 * query time from the user's question — see SKILL.md.
 *
 * Pipeline:
 *
 *   1. Seed: fetch a small recent assignee-plate sample (~25 issues). Its
 *      only purpose is to surface the cf catalog as it exists on *this*
 *      Redmine — names like "Developer" / "Tester" aren't hardcoded ids;
 *      different installs bind them to different cf ids.
 *
 *   2. Probe per role: for each role pattern with a matching cf in the
 *      catalog, query Redmine directly: `GET /issues.json?cf_<id>=<userId>
 *      &limit=1`. Read `total_count`. If it >= the threshold, the user
 *      genuinely holds that role on this instance.
 *
 *      Probing matters because in this workflow the
 *      assignee is typically the requestor / lead, NOT the developer —
 *      so the user's developer-cf issues do *not* show up in their own
 *      assignee plate. Counting cf hits in the seed sample misses them
 *      entirely. Probing asks Redmine the question we actually care about
 *      ("how many issues have me in cf X?") instead of inferring it from
 *      a tangentially-related sample.
 *
 *   3. If no role probes positive AND no `--role` override was given,
 *      fall back to an interactive multi-select (TTY) or throw
 *      VALIDATION_MISSING_FLAG (non-TTY) telling the agent to pass --role.
 *
 *   4. Build the `Me` record. Throws if any role's cf is missing on this
 *      instance — that's a real misconfig, not a degraded state.
 *
 * The orchestrator throws on every failure path. There is no "logged in
 * but role unset" half-state; if `buildMeProfile` returns, the result
 * satisfies the schema.
